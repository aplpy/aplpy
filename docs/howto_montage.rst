Installing Montage
------------------

Montage is a package developed by IPAC designed to handle the
reprojection of FITS files. APLpy relies on Montage for several functions,
such as ``aplpy.make_rgb_cube()`` or the ``north=True``
argument in ``aplpy.FITSFigure()``. To use these features,
Montage needs to be installed.
