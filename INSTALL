Installing APLpy
++++++++++++++++


Installation Instructions
=========================

numpy and matplotlib
--------------------

APLpy requires numpy-1.3.0 or later, and matplotlib-0.99 or later.

You can download the required packages from the numpy and matplotlib
home pages and install these using the standard installation method,
for example:

    tar xvzf numpy-1.3.0.tar.gz 
    cd numpy-1.3.0
    sudo python setup.py install

Be sure to install numpy before matplotlib! If you run into complications installing any of these packages you should go to the numpy and/or matplotlib mailing lists for help.



pyfits
------

In order to read/write FITS files, APLpy requires pyfits-2.1 or later
to be installed. The pyfits module is developed at the Space Telescope
Science Institute, and the link can be found at the bottom of this
file. Once you have the gzipped tar file downloaded, you can either
install it using the standard installation method:

    tar -xvzf pyfits-2.x.x.tar.gz 
    cd pyfits-2.x.x 
    sudo python setup.py install



pywcs
-----
In order to use the World Coordinate System (WCS) information contained
in FITS file headers, APLpy requires pywcs. The pywcs module is
developed at the Space Telescope Science Institute, and can be
downloaded through the link provided at the bottom. Once you have the
tar file downloaded, you can either install it using the standard
installation method:

    tar -xvzf pywcs-1.5.x-x.x.x.tar.gz 
    cd pywcs-1.5.x-x.x.x 
    sudo python setup.py install



Montage (optional)
------------------

Currently, two features in APLpy (re-projecting a FITS file to point
north and making RGB images) requires Montage to be installed. Montage
is a set of tools developed at the Infrared Processing and Analysis
Center (IPAC) to re-project and mosaic FITS files. Installation
instructions are available on the Montage website. Montage's URL is
provided at the bottom of this file.
